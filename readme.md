Should I follow this fellow?  Visiting the public profile makes it hard to tell as it's littered with @ replies, replies
that you'll never see if you do follow them.  So let's strip those away.

### reqs

    $ pip install twitter
    $ pip install flask

### would-be-nice

 - oauth with twitter so you can click a follow button from the site
 - get twitter's suggestions for who to follow
